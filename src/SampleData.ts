export const email = `"Thanks, Dan. Dave updated the daycare. I am assuming he told the kids he was picking up this morning and about the plans he mentioned so am now worried they will confused/upset tonight. Dave never shares info with me so I don’t know what the plans were, though.

He missed Jules’ Christmas program yesterday without letting me or Jules know he wouldn’t be there. My sister flew out and my parents drove 12 hours to attend. Jules asked me why dad wasn’t there. Dave failed to inform any of his family about the program either. 

There was a ridiculous backpack issue he caused last week/this week that the daycare finally had to address with him (after he dismissed me and hung up on me when I tried). 

I’m sure you can see how this pattern is psychologically damaging to the kids. There are issues several times each week where he forgets important things, doesn’t communicate, messes up the schedule, etc. etc. When we were married I handled it all and fixed it all for him, but with shared custody I can no longer protect the kids from it fully. This is the simplest the kids’ lives will ever be and Dave still struggles. Due to his ADHD, it doesn’t seem that he is able to be a competent parent on his own, nor emotionally mature enough to handle 50/50 custody. I continue to very concerned."
